# QMDS

QMDS: Quick Markdown Server, very simple content management using Markdown.

It's a PSGI Perl app meant to be used behind Nginx, and to serve Markdown files from a given folder, using [CMark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) for parsing.

### Obsidian

I edit my files with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), so there's a certain amount of compatibility with it.
